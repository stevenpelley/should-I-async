# TODO

This file acts as a rough list and description of tasks to be done or ideas under discussion

## Next Steps
Golang separate client and server into distinct commands
Docker test harness
measure application performance (requests/s)
profile using OS level tools
profile using any language-specific tools
consider instrumented profiling (added code or PIN)

## Design
Decide how a test ends. likely catch a signal and then print a uniform report to STDOUT
Can also consider providing a control plane/metrics HTTP server for output

## Tooling
Devcontainer?
