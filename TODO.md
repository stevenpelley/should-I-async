# TODO

This file acts as a rough list and description of tasks to be done or ideas under discussion

## Next Steps

### Test Harness and Profile Tooling
Docker test harness
profile using OS level tools
profile using any language-specific tools
consider instrumented profiling (added code or PIN)

### Golang
Add server-side sleep

### Java
many-round-trips test
virtual threads test/demo
command app
measure application performance

### Dev Tooling
Devcontainer
Can we auto-install plugins?  Is this included in devcontainer?  Are personal configurations allowed on top of that?
